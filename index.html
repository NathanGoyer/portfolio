              <img src="headshotnathan.jpg" alt="headshot of nathan" width="200" height="150">
              <p>I am a student at the University of Arkansas Little Rock graduating in 2021 as an Information Science 
              major.<br>I am a creator first and foremost. I have written a novel, developed a mobile game with over 20,000
              downloads,<br> and even created a tabletop card game.<br>
              All these endeavors I started/lead, and then completed, meaning that I have experience<br>in all aspects of project development.</p>
              <p>I also have tutored children and teenagers for a number of years, and trained over 30 employees at my previous job of Paner Bread.<br>
              This has allowed me to gain the ability to explain complex problems in simple terms, and how to equip others to complete a task.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I spend a great deal of personal time on projects, including novel writing, game design, and card game design.<br>
            Over the past few years I have released a number of the products I have worked on. <br>
            Completing these have improved my project management and design skills, along with many others such as editing, proper testing, <br>
            and coming up with solutions for difficult problems. <br>
            My personal philosphy is instead of thinking what I can do, I should decide what I would ike to do and find a way to accomplish it.</p>

            <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
 <p>Dear whom it may concern,</p>
 <p>I am a creative designer who has approached various different industries and mediums.<br>
 Creating prouducts and taking on projects is my passion, and I have found quite a bit of success<br>
 in my endeavors. A lot of my success comes from my personal investment and determination into my work.<br>
 When writing my novel, I would average 2000-5000 words a day. And when developing my mobile game I <br>
 accrued over 1000 hours of logged time self-teaching and experimenting before releasing my first product.<br>
 With this in mine, you can rest assured that I am no stranger to working hard to accomplish my goals.</p>
 <h3>My Projects</h3>
 <ul>
     <li>Premium Mobile Game: Heedless</li>
     <li>Free Mobile Game: Trials of Endgear</li>
     <li>Card Game: Heedless the Card Game</li>
     <li>Novel: Bask - City of Shadows</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In addition to my creative work, I have also worked as a trainer, and a tutor.<br>
 Both experiences taught me not only how to teach others, but work with others in overcoming<br>
 difficult and/or stressful situations and problems. I have learned to be patient with others<br>
 and help others achieve better things.</p>
 <p>For more information about me, please look over the other sections of this site, and my resume<br>
 in order to see my full skillset and accomplishments. And if you have any questions please feel<br>
 free to reach out to me.</p>
 <p>Thank you for your consideration,<br>
 Nathan Goyer</p>
