         <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. 
         Clarity is not the same as simplicity. 
         Often, simple things are clear if the intended message is to be brief and small, 
         but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of
         data.</p>
         <p style="color:Gray";>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not to be reduced to
         meaningless "bit-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.</p>
         <p>Clarity refers to the focus of one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to
         accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
         <h3>Questions</h3>
         <h4>Eplain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>
         <p>Alt is used when in image cannot be loaded, while title is just what the title of the image is when moused over. Title doesn't work with SEO.</p>
         <h4>Please provide an example of how to mark up a defenition from the dictionary below.</h4>
         <p><dfn>Cats</dfn> are small carnivorous mammals who think they own the world.</p>
         <h4>Provide an example of a link from your favorite site.</h4>
         <p>I like <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> as well.</p>
